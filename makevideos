#
#  A leetv utility program
#
#  Create basic bumper/fill videos from still images for leetv
#
#  NOTE:  For the fill video, I use an audio file (fill.mp3) which
#         is a composite of a number of classic TV theme songs from
#         a CD I purchased years ago.  Obviously, this file is not
#         legally distributable, so you must come up with your own
#         soundtrack file(s) to create the bumper/fill videos (or
#         use no sound at all).

# make the raw 5-second bumper video (with audio) - to be post-processed by ltv-createbumper
ffmpeg -loop 1 -i bumper.png -i bumper.m4a -c:v libx264 -t 5 -pix_fmt yuv420p bumper.mp4
# make the 1/2 hour fill video (minus 30 seconds to make room for news/weather) (with audio)
ffmpeg -loop 1 -i fill.png -i fill.mp3 -c:v libx264 -t 1770 -pix_fmt yuv420p fill.mp4
